"""
Data model for the Class -> Student -> Image relationship
(new feature: Teacher Grading + multiple photos per student).

A "Class" isn't its own object yet -- app.py just keeps a list of
Student objects, since class_name is the only other thing tracked
per-class right now. Each Student owns the folder it was assigned
and every ImageRecord discovered inside that folder.

Keeping this as one small module -- rather than spreading these
fields across app.py as loose variables -- is what makes the *next*
step (average score per student -> DataFrame) simple later: every
number scoring needs already hangs off Student.images.

No CustomTkinter or GUI dependency here (spec section 8) -- same
rule as core/rules.py and core/scoring.py.
