"""
Data model for a persisted Class (new feature: Class Management,
extended with per-photo data -- Rule Engine / Teacher / Total Score
and Photo Notes).

This is deliberately a *separate* concept from core.student.Student:

  - core.student.Student / ImageRecord hold live, in-memory review
    state (scanned ImageRecord objects, Rule Engine / Teacher scores)
    for whatever review flow is currently on screen.

  - ClassRecord / ClassStudentEntry / ClassPhotoEntry hold the
    lightweight, JSON-safe summary of a class (name, students,
    photos, and each photo's persisted scores/note) that gets
    written to disk via storage.class_storage so it survives an app
    restart. Nothing here is CustomTkinter-aware or scans folders
    itself -- that stays in core.image / student_setup.py / the
    Class Screen, which pass already-known photo paths in here.

No CustomTkinter dependency here (spec section 8) -- same rule as
core/rules.py and core/scoring.py.
